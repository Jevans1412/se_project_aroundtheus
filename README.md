# Project 3: Around The U.S.
Title: Around The U.S.
  
  
**Intro**
  
Hello all! My name is Jeremy Evans, this project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Starting from scratch in order to replicate the mockup that is posted below availabe on figma or this current README file. The idea is to make it responsive from 1280px to 320px while keeping all elements from sticking to the left side. Hope you enjoy!  

* Flexboxes
* Grids
* Calc Function
* Margins
* Positioning
* BEM Structure and labeling
* Grid template
